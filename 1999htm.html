          <p><strong>BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.</strong> </p>
        </center>
        <p>&nbsp;
        <p><strong>To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:</strong> 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our gain in net worth during 1999 
              was $358 million, which increased the per-share book value of both 
              our Class A and Class B stock by 0.5%. Over the last 35 years (that 
              is, since present management took over) per-share book value has 
              grown from $19 to $37,987, a rate of 24.0% compounded annually.<sup>*</sup> </p>
	    <hr width="40%" align="left">
        <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All figures used in this report apply 
          to Berkshire's A shares, the successor to the only stock that the company 
          had outstanding before 1996. The B shares have an economic interest 
          equal to 1/30th that of the A. 
       	</p>
	<hr width="40%" align="left">
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The numbers on the facing page show 
              just how poor our 1999 record was. We had the worst absolute performance 
              of my tenure and, compared to the S&amp;P, the worst relative performance 
              as well. Relative results are what concern us: Over time, bad relative 
              numbers will produce unsatisfactory absolute results.</p>
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even Inspector Clouseau could find 
              last year's guilty party: your Chairman. My performance reminds 
              me of the quarterback whose report card showed four Fs and a D but 
              who nonetheless had an understanding coach. "Son," he drawled, "I 
              think you're spending too much time on that one subject." 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My "one subject" is capital allocation, 
              and my grade for 1999 most assuredly is a D. What most hurt us during 
              the year was the inferior performance of Berkshire's equity portfolio 
              -- and responsibility for that portfolio, leaving aside the small 
              piece of it run by Lou Simpson of GEICO, is entirely mine. Several 
              of our largest investees badly lagged the market in 1999 because 
              they've had disappointing operating results. We still like these 
              businesses and are content to have major investments in them. But 
              their stumbles damaged our performance last year, and it's no sure 
              thing that they will quickly regain their stride. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fallout from our weak results 
              in 1999 was a more-than-commensurate drop in our stock price. In 
              1998, to go back a bit, the stock outperformed the business. Last 
              year the business did much better than the stock, a divergence that 
              has continued to the date of this letter. Over time, of course, 
              the performance of the stock <em>must </em>roughly match the performance 
              of the business. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite our poor showing last year, 
              Charlie Munger, Berkshire's Vice Chairman and my partner, and I 
              expect that the gain in Berkshire's intrinsic value over the next 
              decade will modestly exceed the gain from owning the S&amp;P. We 
              can't guarantee that, of course. But we are willing to back our 
              conviction with our own money. To repeat a fact you've heard before, 
              well over 99% of my net worth resides in Berkshire. Neither my wife 
              nor I have ever sold a share of Berkshire and -- unless our checks 
              stop clearing -- we have no intention of doing so. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please note that I spoke of hoping 
              to beat the S&amp;P "modestly." For Berkshire, truly large superiorities 
              over that index are a thing of the past. They existed then because 
              we could buy both businesses and stocks at far more attractive prices 
              than we can now, and also because we then had a much smaller capital 
              base, a situation that allowed us to consider a much wider range 
              of investment opportunities than are available to us today. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our optimism about Berkshire's performance 
              is also tempered by the expectation -- indeed, in our minds, the 
              virtual certainty -- that the S&amp;P will do far less well in the 
              next decade or two than it has done since 1982. A recent article 
              in Fortune expressed my views as to why this is inevitable, and 
              I'm enclosing a copy with this report. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our goal is to run our present businesses 
              well -- a task made easy because of the outstanding managers we 
              have in place -- and to acquire additional businesses having economic 
              characteristics and managers comparable to those we already own. 
              We made important progress in this respect during 1999 by acquiring 
              Jordan's Furniture and contracting to buy a major portion of MidAmerican 
              Energy. We will talk more about these companies later in the report 
              but let me emphasize one point here: We bought both for cash, issuing 
              no Berkshire shares. Deals of that kind aren't always possible, 
              but that is the method of acquisition that Charlie and I vastly 
              prefer.

        <p><strong>Guides to Intrinsic Value</strong> <br wp="br1">
          <br wp="br2">
            <p><strong> </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I often talk in 
              these pages about intrinsic value, a key, though far from precise, 
              measurement we utilize in our acquisitions of businesses and common 
              stocks. (For an extensive discussion of this, and other investment 
              and accounting terms and concepts, please refer to our Owner's Manual 
              on pages 55 - 62. Intrinsic value is discussed on page 60.) 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our last four reports, we have 
              furnished you a table that we regard as useful in estimating Berkshire's 
              intrinsic value. In the updated version of that table, which follows, 
              we trace two key components of value. The first column lists our 
              per-share ownership of investments (including cash and equivalents 
              but excluding assets held in our financial products operation) and 
              the second column shows our per-share earnings from Berkshire's 
              operating businesses before taxes and purchase-accounting adjustments 
              (discussed on page 61), but after all interest and corporate expenses. 
              The second column excludes <em>all</em> dividends, interest and 
              capital gains that we realized from the investments presented in 
              the first column. In effect, the columns show how Berkshire would 
              look if it were split into two parts, with one entity holding our 
              investments and the other operating all of our businesses and bearing 
              all corporate costs.

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1999, our per-share investments 
              changed very little, but our operating earnings, affected by negatives 
              that overwhelmed some strong positives, fell apart. Most of our 
              operating managers deserve a grade of A for delivering fine results 
              and for having widened the difference between the intrinsic value 
              of their businesses and the value at which these are carried on 
              our balance sheet. But, offsetting this, we had a huge -- and, I 
              believe, aberrational -- underwriting loss at General Re. Additionally, 
              GEICO's underwriting profit fell, as we had predicted it would. 
              GEICO's overall performance, though, was terrific, outstripping 
              my ambitious goals. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not expect our underwriting 
              earnings to improve in any dramatic way this year. Though GEICO's 
              intrinsic value should grow by a highly satisfying amount, its underwriting 
              performance is almost certain to weaken. That's because auto insurers, 
              as a group, will do worse in 2000, and because we will materially 
              increase our marketing expenditures. At General Re, we are raising 
              rates and, if there is no mega-catastrophe in 2000, the company's 
              underwriting loss should fall considerably. It takes some time, 
              however, for the full effect of rate increases to kick in, and General 
              Re is therefore likely to have another unsatisfactory underwriting 
              year. <br wp="br1">
              <br wp="br2">
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You should be aware that one item 
              regularly working to widen the amount by which intrinsic value exceeds 
              book value is the annual charge against income we take for amortization 
              of goodwill -- an amount now running about $500 million. This charge 
              reduces the amount of goodwill we show as an asset and likewise 
              the amount that is included in our book value. This is an accounting 
              matter having nothing to do with true economic goodwill, which increases 
              in most years. But even if economic goodwill were to remain constant, 
              the annual amortization charge would persistently widen the gap 
              between intrinsic value and book value. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though we can't give you a precise 
              figure for Berkshire's intrinsic value, or even an approximation, 
              Charlie and I can assure you that it far exceeds our $57.8 billion 
              book value. Businesses such as See's and Buffalo News are now worth 
              fifteen to twenty times the value at which they are carried on our 
              books. Our goal is to continually widen this spread at all subsidiaries.

            <p><strong>A Managerial Story You Will Never Read Elsewhere</strong> <br wp="br1">
          <br wp="br2">
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Berkshire's collection of managers 
              is unusual in several important ways. As one example, a very high percentage 
              of these men and women are independently wealthy, having made fortunes 
              in the businesses that they run. They work neither because they 
              need the money nor because they are contractually obligated to -- 
              we have no contracts at Berkshire. Rather, they work long and hard 
              because they love their businesses. And I use the word "their" advisedly, 
              since these managers are truly in charge -- there are no show-and-tell 
              presentations in Omaha, no budgets to be approved by headquarters, 
              no dictums issued about capital expenditures. We simply ask our 
              managers to run their companies as if these are the sole asset of 
              their families and will remain so for the next century. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie and I try to behave with 
              our managers just as we attempt to behave with Berkshire's shareholders, 
              treating both groups as we would wish to be treated if our positions 
              were reversed. Though "working" means nothing to me financially, 
              I love doing it at Berkshire for some simple reasons: It gives me 
              a sense of achievement, a freedom to act as I see fit and an opportunity 
              to interact daily with people I like and trust. Why should our managers 
              -- accomplished artists at what they do -- see things differently? 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their relations with Berkshire, 
              our managers often appear to be hewing to President Kennedy's charge, 
              "Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for 
              your country." Here's a remarkable story from last year: It's about 
              R. C. Willey, Utah's dominant home furnishing business, which Berkshire 
              purchased from Bill Child and his family in 1995. Bill and most 
              of his managers are Mormons, and for this reason R. C. Willey's 
              stores have never operated on Sunday. This is a difficult way to 
              do business: Sunday is the favorite shopping day for many customers. 
              Bill, nonetheless, stuck to his principles -- and while doing so 
              built his business from $250,000 of annual sales in 1954, when he 
              took over, to $342 million in 1999. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill felt that R. C. Willey could 
              operate successfully in markets outside of Utah and in 1997 suggested 
              that we open a store in Boise. I was highly skeptical about taking 
              a no-Sunday policy into a new territory where we would be up against 
              entrenched rivals open seven days a week. Nevertheless, this was 
              Bill's business to run. So, despite my reservations, I told him 
              to follow both his business judgment and his religious convictions. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill then insisted on a truly extraordinary 
              proposition: He would personally buy the land and build the store 
              -- for about $9 million as it turned out -- and would sell it to 
              us at his cost if it proved to be successful. On the other hand, 
              if sales fell short of his expectations, we could exit the business 
              without paying Bill a cent. This outcome, of course, would leave 
              him with a huge investment in an empty building. I told him that 
              I appreciated his offer but felt that if Berkshire was going to 
              get the upside it should also take the downside. Bill said nothing 
              doing: If there was to be failure because of his religious beliefs, 
              he wanted to take the blow personally. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The store opened last August and 
              immediately became a huge success. Bill thereupon turned the property 
              over to us -- including some extra land that had appreciated significantly 
              -- and we wrote him a check for his cost. And get this: <em>Bill

              in August, we had a grand opening of the Boise store about a month 
              later. Naturally, I went there to cut the ribbon (your Chairman, 
              I wish to emphasize, is good for <em>something</em>). In my talk 
              I told the crowd how sales had far exceeded expectations, making 
              us, by a considerable margin, the largest home furnishings store 
              in Idaho. Then, as the speech progressed, my memory miraculously 
              began to improve. By the end of my talk, it all had come back to 
              me: Opening a store in Boise had been <em>my</em> idea. <br wp="br1">

            <p><strong>The Economics of Property/Casualty Insurance</strong> <br wp="br1">
          <br wp="br2">
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our main business -- though 
              we have others of great importance -- is insurance. To understand 
              Berkshire, therefore, it is necessary that you understand how to 
              evaluate an insurance company. The key determinants are: (1) the 
              amount of float that the business generates; (2) its cost; and (3) 
              most critical of all, the long-term outlook for both of these factors. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To begin with, float is money we 
              hold but don't own. In an insurance operation, float arises because 
              premiums are received before losses are paid, an interval that sometimes 
              extends over many years. During that time, the insurer invests the 
              money. This pleasant activity typically carries with it a downside: 
              The premiums that an insurer takes in usually do not cover the losses 
              and expenses it eventually must pay. That leaves it running an "underwriting 
              loss," which is the cost of float. An insurance business has value 
              if its cost of float over time is less than the cost the company 
              would otherwise incur to obtain funds. But the business is a lemon 
              if its cost of float is higher than market rates for money. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A caution is appropriate here: Because 
              loss costs must be estimated, insurers have enormous latitude in 
              figuring their underwriting results, and that makes it very difficult 
              for investors to calculate a company's true cost of float. Errors 
              of estimation, usually innocent but sometimes not, can be huge. 
              The consequences of these miscalculations flow directly into earnings. 
              An experienced observer can usually detect large-scale errors in 
              reserving, but the general public can typically do no more than 
              accept what's presented, and at times I have been amazed by the 
              numbers that big-name auditors have implicitly blessed. In 1999 
              a number of insurers announced reserve adjustments that made a mockery 
              of the "earnings" that investors had relied on earlier when making 
              their buy and sell decisions. At Berkshire, we strive to be conservative 
              and consistent in our reserving. Even so, we warn you that an unpleasant 
              surprise is always possible. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The table that follows shows (at 
              intervals) the float generated by the various segments of Berkshire's 
              insurance operations since we entered the business 33 years ago 
              upon acquiring National Indemnity Company (whose traditional lines 
              are included in the segment "Other Primary"). For the table we have 
              calculated our float -- which we generate in large amounts relative 
              to our premium volume -- by adding net loss reserves, loss adjustment 
              reserves, funds held under reinsurance assumed and unearned premium 
              reserves, and then subtracting agents balances, prepaid acquisition 
              costs, prepaid taxes and deferred charges applicable to assumed 
              reinsurance. (Got that?)

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Growth of float is important -- but 
              its cost is what's vital. Over the years we have usually recorded 
              only a small underwriting loss -- which means our cost of float 
              was correspondingly low -- or actually had an underwriting profit, 
              which means we were being <em>paid</em> for holding other people's 
              money. Indeed, our cumulative result through 1998 was an underwriting 
              profit. In 1999, however, we incurred a $1.4 billion underwriting 
              loss that left us with float cost of 5.8%. One mildly mitigating 
              factor: We enthusiastically welcomed $400 million of the loss because 
              it stems from business that will deliver us exceptional float over 
              the next decade. The balance of the loss, however, was decidedly 
              unwelcome, and our overall result must be judged extremely poor. 
              Absent a mega-catastrophe, we expect float cost to fall in 2000, 
              but any decline will be tempered by our aggressive plans for GEICO, 
              which we will discuss later. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a number of people 
              who deserve credit for manufacturing so much "no-cost" float over 
              the years. Foremost is Ajit Jain. It's simply impossible to overstate 
              Ajit's value to Berkshire: He has from scratch built an outstanding 
              reinsurance business, which during his tenure has earned an underwriting 
              profit and now holds $6.3 billion of float. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Ajit, we have an underwriter 
              equipped with the intelligence to properly rate most risks; the 
              realism to forget about those he can't evaluate; the courage to 
              write huge policies when the premium is appropriate; and the discipline 
              to reject even the smallest risk when the premium is inadequate. 
              It is rare to find a person possessing any one of these talents. 
              For one person to have them all is remarkable. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Ajit specializes in super-cat 
              reinsurance, a line in which losses are infrequent but extremely 
              large when they occur, his business is sure to be far more volatile 
              than most insurance operations. To date, we have benefitted from 
              good luck on this volatile book. Even so, Ajit's achievements are 
              truly extraordinary. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a smaller but nevertheless important 
              way, our "other primary" insurance operation has also added to Berkshire's 
              intrinsic value. This collection of insurers has delivered a $192 
              million underwriting profit over the past five years while supplying 
              us with the float shown in the table. In the insurance world, results 
              like this are uncommon, and for their feat we thank Rod Eldred, 
              Brad Kinstler, John Kizer, Don Towle and Don Wurster. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned earlier, the 
              General Re operation had an exceptionally poor underwriting year 
              in 1999 (though investment income left the company well in the black). 
              Our business was extremely underpriced, both domestically and internationally, 
              a condition that is improving but not yet corrected. Over time, 
              however, the company should develop a growing amount of low-cost 
              float. At both General Re and its Cologne subsidiary, incentive 
              compensation plans are now directly tied to the variables of float 
              growth and cost of float, the same variables that determine value 
              for owners. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though a reinsurer may 
              have a tightly focused and rational compensation system, it cannot 
              count on every year coming up roses. Reinsurance is a highly volatile 
              business, and neither General Re nor Ajit's operation is immune 
              to bad pricing behavior in the industry. But General Re has the 
              distribution, the underwriting skills, the culture, and -- with 
              Berkshire's backing -- the financial clout to become the world's 
              most profitable reinsurance company. Getting there will take time, 
              energy and discipline, but we have no doubt that Ron Ferguson and 
              his crew can make it happen. <br wp="br1">

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1995, GEICO spent $33 million 
              on marketing and had 652 telephone counselors. Last year the company 
              spent $242 million, and the counselor count grew to 2,631. And we 
              are just starting: The pace will step up materially in 2000. Indeed, 
              we would happily commit $1 billion annually to marketing if we knew 
              we could handle the business smoothly and if we expected the last 
              dollar spent to produce new business at an attractive cost. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently two trends are affecting 
              acquisition costs. The bad news is that it has become more expensive 
              to develop inquiries. Media rates have risen, and we are also seeing 
              diminishing returns -- that is, as both we and our competitors step 
              up advertising, inquiries per ad fall for all of us. These negatives 
              are partly offset, however, by the fact that our closure ratio -- 
              the percentage of inquiries converted to sales -- has steadily improved. 
              Overall, we believe that our cost of new business, though definitely 
              rising, is well below that of the industry. Of even greater importance, 
              our operating costs for renewal business are the lowest among broad-based 
              national auto insurers. Both of these major competitive advantages 
              are sustainable. Others may copy our model, but 
              they will be unable to replicate our economics. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The table above makes it appear 
              that GEICO's retention of policyholders is falling, but for two 
              reasons appearances are in this case deceiving. First, in the last 
              few years our business mix has moved away from "preferred" policyholders, 
              for whom industrywide retention rates are high, toward "standard" 
              and "non-standard" policyholders for whom retention rates are much 
              lower. (Despite the nomenclature, the three classes have similar 
              profit prospects.) Second, retention rates for relatively new policyholders 
              are always lower than those for long-time customers -- and because 
              of our accelerated growth, our policyholder ranks now include an 
              increased proportion of new customers. Adjusted for these two factors, 
              our retention rate has changed hardly at all. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We told you last year that underwriting 
              margins for both GEICO and the industry would fall in 1999, and 
              they did. We make a similar prediction for 2000. A few years ago 
              margins got too wide, having enjoyed the effects of an unusual and 
              unexpected decrease in the frequency and severity of accidents. 
              The industry responded by reducing rates -- but now is having to 
              contend with an increase in loss costs. We would not be surprised 
              to see the margins of auto insurers deteriorate by around three 
              percentage points in 2000. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two negatives besides worsening 
              frequency and severity will hurt the industry this year. First, 
              rate increases go into effect only slowly, both because of regulatory 
              delay and because insurance contracts must run their course before 
              new rates can be put in. Second, reported earnings of many auto 
              insurers have benefitted in the last few years from reserve releases, 
              made possible because the companies overestimated their loss costs 
              in still-earlier years. This reservoir of redundant reserves has 
              now largely dried up, and future boosts to earnings from this source 
              will be minor at best. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In compensating its associates -- 
              from Tony on down -- GEICO continues to use two variables, and only 
              two, in determining what bonuses and profit-sharing contributions 
              will be: 1) its percentage growth in policyholders and 2) the earnings 
              of its "seasoned" business, meaning policies that have been with 
              us for more than a year. We did outstandingly well on both fronts 
              during 1999 and therefore made a profit-sharing payment of 28.4% 
              of salary (in total, $113.3 million) to the great majority of our 
              associates. Tony and I love writing those checks. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Berkshire, we want to have compensation 
              policies that are both easy to understand and in sync with what 
              we wish our associates to accomplish. Writing new business is expensive 
              (and, as mentioned, getting more expensive). If we were to include 
              those costs in our calculation of bonuses -- as managements did 
              before our arrival at GEICO -- we would be penalizing our associates 
              for garnering new policies, even though these are very much in Berkshire's 
              interest. So, in effect, we say to our associates that we will foot 
              the bill for new business. Indeed, because percentage growth in 
              policyholders is part of our compensation scheme, we <em>reward</em> 
              our associates for producing this initially-unprofitable business. 
              And then we reward them additionally for holding down costs on our 
              seasoned business. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the extensive advertising 
              we do, our best source of new business is word-of-mouth recommendations 
              from existing policyholders, who on the whole are pleased with our 
              prices and service. An article published last year by <em>Kiplinger's 
              Personal Finance</em> <em>Magazine</em> gives a good picture of 
              where we stand in customer satisfaction: The magazine's survey of 
              20 state insurance departments showed that GEICO's complaint ratio 
              was well below the ratio for most of its major competitors. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our strong referral business means 
              that we probably could maintain our policy count by spending as 
              little as $50 million annually on advertising. That's a guess, of 
              course, and we will never know whether it is accurate because Tony's 
              foot is going to stay on the advertising pedal (and my foot will 
              be on his). Nevertheless, I want to emphasize that a major percentage 
              of the $300-$350 million we will spend in 2000 on advertising, as 
              well as large additional costs we will incur for sales counselors, 
              communications and facilities, are optional outlays we choose to 
              make so that we can both achieve significant growth and extend and 
              solidify the promise of the GEICO brand in the minds of Americans. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personally, I think these expenditures 
              are the best investment Berkshire can make. Through its advertising, 
              GEICO is acquiring a direct relationship with a huge number of households 
              that, on average, will send us $1,100 year after year. That makes 
              us -- among all companies, selling whatever kind of product -- one 
              of the country's leading direct merchandisers. Also, as we build 
              our long-term relationships with more and more families, cash is 
              pouring in rather than going out (no Internet economics here). Last 
              year, as GEICO increased its customer base by 766,256, it gained 
              $590 million of cash from operating earnings and the increase in 
              float. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past three years, we have 
              increased our market share in personal auto insurance from 2.7% 
              to 4.1%. But we rightfully belong in many more households -- maybe 
              even yours. Give us a call and find out. About 40% of those people 
              checking our rates find that they can save money by doing business 
              with us. The proportion is not 100% because insurers differ in their 
              underwriting judgments, with some giving more credit than we do 
              to drivers who live in certain geographic areas or work at certain 
              occupations. Our closure rate indicates, however, that we more frequently 
              offer the low price than does any other national carrier selling 
              insurance to all comers. Furthermore, in 40 states we can offer 
              a special discount -- usually 8% -- to our shareholders. Just be 
              sure to identify yourself as a Berkshire owner so that our sales 
              counselor can make the appropriate adjustment.

            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's with sadness that I report 
              to you that Lorimer Davidson, GEICO's former Chairman, died last 
              November, a few days after his 97<sup>th</sup> birthday. For GEICO, 
              Davy was a business giant who moved the company up to the big leagues. 
              For me, he was a friend, teacher and hero. I have told you of his 
              lifelong kindnesses to me in past reports. Clearly, my life would 
              have developed far differently had he not been a part of it. Tony, 
              Lou Simpson and I visited Davy in August and marveled at his mental 
              alertness -- particularly in all matters regarding GEICO. He was 
              the company's number one supporter right up to the end, and we will 
              forever miss him. <br wp="br1">
              <br wp="br2">
            <p><strong>Aviation Services</strong> <br wp="br1">
              <br wp="br2">
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our two aviation services companies 
              -- FlightSafety International ("FSI") and Executive Jet Aviation 
              ("EJA") -- are both runaway leaders in their field. EJA, which sells 
              and manages the fractional ownership of jet aircraft, through its 
              NetJets&reg; program, is larger than its next two competitors combined. 
              FSI trains pilots (as well as other transportation professionals) 
              and is five times or so the size of its nearest competitor. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another common characteristic of 
              the companies is that they are still managed by their founding entrepreneurs. 
              Al Ueltschi started FSI in 1951 with $10,000, and Rich Santulli 
              invented the fractional-ownership industry in 1986. These men are 
              both remarkable managers who have no financial need to work but 
              thrive on helping their companies grow and excel. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though these two businesses have 
              leadership positions that are similar, they differ in their economic 
              characteristics. FSI must lay out huge amounts of capital. A single 
              flight simulator can cost as much as $15 million -- and we have 
              222. Only one person at a time, furthermore, can be trained in a 
              simulator, which means that the capital investment per dollar of 
              revenue at FSI is exceptionally high. Operating margins must therefore 
              also be high, if we are to earn a reasonable return on capital. 
              Last year we made capital expenditures of $215 million at FSI and 
              FlightSafety Boeing, its 50%-owned affiliate. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At EJA, in contrast, the customer 
              owns the equipment, though we, of course, must invest in a core 
              fleet of our own planes to ensure outstanding service. For example, 
              the Sunday after Thanksgiving, EJA's busiest day of the year, strains 
              our resources since fractions of 169 planes are owned by 1,412 customers, 
              many of whom are bent on flying home between 3 and 6 p.m. On that 
              day, and certain others, we need a supply of company-owned aircraft 
              to make sure all parties get where they want, when they want. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, most of the planes 
              we fly are owned by customers, which means that modest pre-tax margins 
              in this business can produce good returns on equity. Currently, 
              our customers own planes worth over $2 billion, and in addition 
              we have $4.2 billion of planes on order. Indeed, the limiting factor 
              in our business right now is the availability of planes. We now 
              are taking delivery of about 8% of all business jets manufactured 
              in the world, and we wish we could get a bigger share than that. 
              Though EJA was supply-constrained in 1999, its recurring revenues 
              -- monthly management fees plus hourly flight fees -- increased 
              46%. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fractional-ownership industry 
              is still in its infancy. EJA is now building critical mass in Europe, 
              and over time we will expand around the world. Doing that will be 
              expensive -- very expensive -- but we will spend what it takes. 
              Scale is vital to both us and our customers: The company with the 
              most planes in the air worldwide will be able to offer its customers 
              the best service. "Buy a fraction, get a fleet" has real meaning 
              at EJA. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EJA enjoys another important advantage 
              in that its two largest competitors are both subsidiaries of aircraft 
              manufacturers and sell only the aircraft their parents make. Though 
              these are fine planes, these competitors are severely limited in 
              the cabin styles and mission capabilities they can offer. EJA, in 
              contrast, offers a wide array of planes from five suppliers. Consequently, 
              we can give the customer whatever<em> he</em> needs to buy -- rather 
              than his getting what the competitor's parent needs to sell. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year in this report, I described 
              my family's delight with the one-quarter (200 flight hours annually) 
              of a Hawker 1000 that we had owned since 1995. I got so pumped up 
              by my own prose that shortly thereafter I signed up for one-sixteenth 
              of a Cessna V Ultra as well. Now my annual outlays at EJA and Borsheim's, 
              combined, total ten times my salary. Think of this as a rough guideline 
              for your own expenditures with us. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the past year, two of Berkshire's 
              outside directors have also signed on with EJA. (Maybe we're paying 
              them too much.) You should be aware that they and I are charged 
              exactly the same price for planes and service as is any other customer: 
              EJA follows a "most favored nations" policy, with no one getting 
              a special deal. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, brace yourself. Last year, 
              EJA passed the ultimate test: <em>Charlie signed up.</em> No other 
              endorsement could speak more eloquently to the value of the EJA 
              service. Give us a call at 1-800-848-6436 and ask for our "white 
              paper" on fractional ownership. <br wp="br1">

            <p><strong>Acquisitions of 1999</strong> <br wp="br1">
              <br wp="br2">
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At both GEICO and Executive Jet, 
              our best source of new customers is the happy ones we already have. 
              Indeed, about 65% of our new owners of aircraft come as referrals 
              from current owners who have fallen in love with the service. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our acquisitions usually develop 
              in the same way. At other companies, executives may devote themselves 
              to pursuing acquisition possibilities with investment bankers, utilizing 
              an auction process that has become standardized. In this exercise 
              the bankers prepare a "book" that makes me think of the Superman 
              comics of my youth. In the Wall Street version, a formerly mild-mannered 
              company emerges from the investment banker's phone booth able to 
              leap over competitors in a single bound and with earnings moving 
              faster than a speeding bullet. Titillated by the book's description 
              of the acquiree's powers, acquisition-hungry CEOs -- Lois Lanes 
              all, beneath their cool exteriors -- promptly swoon. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's particularly entertaining 
              in these books is the precision with which earnings are projected 
              for many years ahead. If you ask the author-banker, however, what 
              his own firm will earn <em>next month</em>, he will go into a protective 
              crouch and tell you that business and markets are far too uncertain 
              for him to venture a forecast. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here's one story I can't resist 
              relating: In 1985, a major investment banking house undertook to 
              sell Scott Fetzer, offering it widely -- but with no success. Upon 
              reading of this strikeout, I wrote Ralph Schey, then and now Scott 
              Fetzer's CEO, expressing an interest in buying the business. I had 
              never met Ralph, but within a week we had a deal. Unfortunately, 
              Scott Fetzer's letter of engagement with the banking firm provided 
              it a $2.5 million fee upon sale, even if it had nothing to do with 
              finding the buyer. I guess the lead banker felt he should do something 
              for his payment, so he graciously offered us a copy of the book 
              on Scott Fetzer that his firm had prepared. With his customary tact, 
              Charlie responded: "I'll pay $2.5 million <em>not</em> to read it." 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Berkshire, our carefully-crafted 
              acquisition strategy is simply to wait for the phone to ring. Happily, 
              it sometimes does so, usually because a manager who sold to us earlier 
              has recommended to a friend that he think about following suit. 
              <br wp="br1">
              <br wp="br2">
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which brings us to the furniture 
              business. Two years ago I recounted how the acquisition of Nebraska 
              Furniture Mart in 1983 and my subsequent association with the Blumkin 
              family led to follow-on transactions with R. C. Willey (1995) and 
              Star Furniture (1997). For me, these relationships have all been 
              terrific. Not only did Berkshire acquire three outstanding retailers; 
              these deals also allowed me to become friends with some of the finest 
              people you will ever meet. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naturally, I have persistently asked 
              the Blumkins, Bill Child and Melvyn Wolff whether there are any 
              more out there like you. Their invariable answer was the Tatelman 
              brothers of New England and their remarkable furniture business, 
              Jordan's. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I met Barry and Eliot Tatelman last 
              year and we soon signed an agreement for Berkshire to acquire the 
              company. Like our three previous furniture acquisitions, this business 
              had long been in the family -- in this case since 1927, when Barry 
              and Eliot's grandfather began operations in a Boston suburb. Under 
              the brothers' management, Jordan's has grown ever more dominant 
              in its region, becoming the largest furniture retailer in New Hampshire 
              as well as Massachusetts. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tatelmans don't just sell furniture 
              or manage stores. They also present customers with a dazzling entertainment 
              experience called "shoppertainment." A family visiting a store can 
              have a terrific time, while concurrently viewing an extraordinary 
              selection of merchandise. The business results are also extraordinary: 
              Jordan's has the highest sales per square foot of any major furniture 
              operation in the country. I urge you to visit one of their stores 
              if you are in the Boston area -- particularly the one at Natick, 
              which is Jordan's newest. Bring money. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barry and Eliot are classy people 
              -- just like their counterparts at Berkshire's three other furniture 
              operations. When they sold to us, they elected to give each of their 
              employees at least 50 for every hour that he or she had worked for 
              Jordan's. This payment added up to $9 million, which came from the 
              Tatelmans' own pockets, not from Berkshire's. And Barry and Eliot 
              were thrilled to write the checks. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each of our furniture operations 
              is number one in its territory. We now sell more furniture than 
              anyone else in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Texas, Nebraska, Utah 
              and Idaho. Last year Star's Melvyn Wolff and his sister, Shirley 
              Toomim, scored two major successes: a move into San Antonio and 
              a significant enlargement of Star's store in Austin. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's no operation in the furniture 
              retailing business remotely like the one assembled by Berkshire. 
              It's fun for me and profitable for you. W. C. Fields once said, 
              "It was a woman who drove me to drink, but unfortunately I never 
              had the chance to thank her." I don't want to make that mistake. 
              My thanks go to Louie, Ron and Irv Blumkin for getting me started 
              in the furniture business and for unerringly guiding me as we have 
              assembled the group we now have. <br wp="br1">

            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, for our second acquisition 
              deal: It came to us through my good friend, Walter Scott, Jr., chairman 
              of Level 3 Communications and a director of Berkshire. Walter has 
              many other business connections as well, and one of them is with 
              MidAmerican Energy, a utility company in which he has substantial 
              holdings and on whose board he sits. At a conference in California 
              that we both attended last September, Walter casually asked me whether 
              Berkshire might be interested in making a large investment in MidAmerican, 
              and from the start the idea of being in partnership with Walter 
              struck me as a good one. Upon returning to Omaha, I read some of 
              MidAmerican's public reports and had two short meetings with Walter 
              and David Sokol, MidAmerican's talented and entrepreneurial CEO. 
              I then said that, at an appropriate price, we would indeed like 
              to make a deal. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Acquisitions in the electric utility 
              industry are complicated by a variety of regulations including the 
              Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. Therefore, we had to 
              structure a transaction that would avoid Berkshire gaining voting 
              control. Instead we are purchasing an 11% fixed-income security, 
              along with a combination of common stock and exchangeable preferred 
              that will give Berkshire just under 10% of the voting power of MidAmerican 
              but about 76% of the equity interest. All told, our investment will 
              be about $2 billion. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walter characteristically backed 
              up his convictions with real money: He and his family will buy more 
              MidAmerican stock for cash when the transaction closes, bringing 
              their total investment to about $280 million. Walter will also be 
              the controlling shareholder of the company, and I can't think of 
              a better person to hold that post. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though there are many regulatory 
              constraints in the utility industry, it's possible that we will 
              make additional commitments in the field. If we do, the amounts 
              involved could be large.<strong></strong> 
            <p><strong>Acquisition Accounting</strong> <br wp="br1">
              <br wp="br2">
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, I would like to make 
              some comments about accounting, in this case about its application 
              to acquisitions. This is currently a very contentious topic and, 
              before the dust settles, Congress may even intervene (a truly terrible 
              idea). 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a company is acquired, generally 
              accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") currently condone two very 
              different ways of recording the transaction: "purchase" and "pooling." 
              In a pooling, stock must be the currency; in a purchase, payment 
              can be made in either cash or stock. Whatever the currency, managements 
              usually detest purchase accounting because it almost always requires 
              that a "goodwill" account be established and subsequently written 
              off -- a process that saddles earnings with a large annual charge 
              that normally persists for decades. In contrast, pooling avoids 
              a goodwill account, which is why managements love it. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Financial Accounting Standards 
              Board ("FASB") has proposed an end to pooling, and many CEOs are 
              girding for battle. It will be an important fight, so we'll venture 
              some opinions. To begin with, we agree with the many managers who 
              argue that goodwill amortization charges are usually spurious. You'll 
              find my thinking about this in the appendix to our 1983 annual report, 
              which is available on our website, and in the Owner's Manual on 
              pages 55 - 62. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For accounting rules to mandate 
              amortization that will, in the usual case, conflict with reality 
              is deeply troublesome: Most accounting charges <em>relate</em> to 
              what's going on, even if they don't precisely measure it. As an 
              example, depreciation charges can't with precision calibrate the 
              decline in value that physical assets suffer, but these charges 
              do at least describe something that is truly occurring: Physical 
              assets invariably deteriorate. Correspondingly, obsolescence charges 
              for inventories, bad debt charges for receivables and accruals for 
              warranties are among the charges that reflect true costs. The annual 
              charges for these expenses can't be exactly measured, but the necessity 
              for estimating them is obvious. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast, economic goodwill does 
              not, in many cases, diminish. Indeed, in a great many instances 
              -- perhaps most -- it actually grows in value over time. In character, 
              economic goodwill is much like land: The value of both assets is 
              sure to fluctuate, but the direction in which value is going to 
              go is in no way ordained. At See's, for example, economic goodwill 
              has grown, in an irregular but very substantial manner, for 78 years. 
              And, if we run the business right, growth of that kind will probably 
              continue for at least another 78 years. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To escape from the fiction of goodwill 
              charges, managers embrace the fiction of pooling. This accounting 
              convention is grounded in the poetic notion that when two rivers 
              merge their streams become indistinguishable. Under this concept, 
              a company that has been merged into a larger enterprise has not 
              been "purchased" (even though it will often have received a large 
              "sell-out" premium). Consequently, no goodwill is created, and those 
              pesky subsequent charges to earnings are eliminated. Instead, the 
              accounting for the ongoing entity is handled as if the businesses 
              had forever been one unit. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So much for poetry. The reality 
              of merging is usually far different: There is indisputably an acquirer 
              and an acquiree, and the latter has been "purchased," no matter 
              how the deal has been structured. If you think otherwise, just ask 
              employees severed from their jobs which company was the conqueror 
              and which was the conquered. You will find no confusion. So on this 
              point the FASB is correct: In most mergers, a purchase has been 
              made. Yes, there are some true "mergers of equals," but they are 
              few and far between. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie and I believe there's a 
              reality-based approach that should both satisfy the FASB, which 
              correctly wishes to record a purchase, and meet the objections of 
              managements to nonsensical charges for diminution of goodwill. We 
              would first have the acquiring company record its purchase price 
              -- whether paid in stock or cash -- at fair value. In most cases, 
              this procedure would create a large asset representing economic 
              goodwill. We would then leave this asset on the books, not requiring 
              its amortization. Later, if the economic goodwill became impaired, 
              as it sometimes would, it would be written down just as would any 
              other asset judged to be impaired. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If our proposed rule were to be 
              adopted, it should be applied retroactively so that acquisition 
              accounting would be consistent throughout America -- a far cry from 
              what exists today. One prediction: If this plan were to take effect, 
              managements would structure acquisitions more sensibly, deciding 
              whether to use cash or stock based on the real consequences for 
              their shareholders rather than on the unreal consequences for their 
              reported earnings. <br wp="br1">

            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our purchase of Jordan's, we 
              followed a procedure that will maximize the cash produced for our 
              shareholders but minimize the earnings we report to you. Berkshire 
              purchased assets for cash, an approach that on our tax returns permits 
              us to amortize the resulting goodwill over a 15-year period. Obviously, 
              this tax deduction materially increases the amount of cash delivered 
              by the business. In contrast, when stock, rather than assets, is 
              purchased for cash, the resulting writeoffs of goodwill are not 
              tax-deductible. The economic difference between these two approaches 
              is substantial. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the economic standpoint of 
              the acquiring company, the worst deal of all is a stock-for-stock 
              acquisition. Here, a huge price is often paid without there being 
              any step-up in the tax basis of either the stock of the acquiree 
              or its assets. If the acquired entity is subsequently sold, its 
              owner may owe a large capital gains tax (at a 35% or greater rate), 
              even though the sale may truly be producing a major economic loss. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have made some deals at Berkshire 
              that used far-from-optimal tax structures. These deals occurred 
              because the sellers insisted on a given structure and because, overall, 
              we still felt the acquisition made sense. We have never done an 
              inefficiently-structured deal, however, in order to make our figures 
              look better. <br wp="br1">

            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The table that follows shows the 
              main sources of Berkshire's reported earnings. In this presentation, 
              purchase-accounting adjustments are not assigned to the specific 
              businesses to which they apply, but are instead aggregated and shown 
              separately. This procedure lets you view the earnings of our businesses 
              as they would have been reported had we not purchased them. For 
              the reasons discussed on page 61, this form of presentation seems 
              to us to be more useful to investors and managers than one utilizing 
              generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which require purchase-premiums 
              to be charged off business-by-business. The total earnings we show 
              in the table are, of course, identical to the GAAP total in our 
              audited financial statements.

            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost all of our manufacturing, 
              retailing and service businesses had excellent results in 1999. 
              The exception was Dexter Shoe, and there the shortfall did not occur 
              because of managerial problems: In skills, energy and devotion to 
              their work, the Dexter executives are every bit the equal of our 
              other managers. But we manufacture shoes primarily in the U.S., 
              and it has become extremely difficult for domestic producers to 
              compete effectively. In 1999, approximately 93% of the 1.3 billion 
              pairs of shoes purchased in this country came from abroad, where 
              extremely low-cost labor is the rule.<strong></strong> 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Counting both Dexter and H. H. Brown, 
              we are currently the leading domestic manufacturer of shoes, and 
              we are likely to continue to be. We have loyal, highly-skilled workers 
              in our U.S. plants, and we want to retain every job here that we 
              can. Nevertheless, in order to remain viable, we are sourcing more 
              of our output internationally. In doing that, we have incurred significant 
              severance and relocation costs that are included in the earnings 
              we show in the table. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few years back, Helzberg's, our 
              200-store jewelry operation, needed to make operating adjustments 
              to restore margins to appropriate levels. Under Jeff Comment's leadership, 
              the job was done and profits have dramatically rebounded. In the 
              shoe business, where we have Harold Alfond, Peter Lunder, Frank 
              Rooney and Jim Issler in charge, I believe we will see a similar 
              improvement over the next few years. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See's Candies deserves a special 
              comment, given that it achieved a record operating margin of 24% 
              last year. Since we bought See's for $25 million in 1972, it has 
              earned $857 million pre-tax. And, despite its growth, the business 
              has required very little additional capital. Give the credit for 
              this performance to Chuck Huggins. Charlie and I put him in charge 
              the day of our purchase, and his fanatical insistence on both product 
              quality and friendly service has rewarded customers, employees and 
              owners. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chuck gets better every year. When 
              he took charge of See's at age 46, the company's pre-tax profit, 
              expressed in millions, was about 10% of his age. Today he's 74, 
              and the ratio has increased to 100%. Having discovered this mathematical 
              relationship -- let's call it Huggins' Law -- Charlie and I now 
              become giddy at the mere thought of Chuck's birthday.

              various businesses is given on pages 39 - 54, where you will also 
              find our segment earnings reported on a GAAP basis. In addition, 
              on pages 63 - 69, we have rearranged Berkshire's financial data 
              into four segments on a non-GAAP basis, a presentation that corresponds 
              to the way Charlie and I think about the company. <br wp="br1">
              <br wp="br2">
            <p><strong>Look-Through Earnings</strong> <br wp="br1">
          <br wp="br2">
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reported earnings are an inadequate 
              measure of economic progress at Berkshire, in part because the numbers 
              shown in the table presented earlier include only the dividends 
              we receive from investees -- though these dividends typically represent 
              only a small fraction of the earnings attributable to our ownership. 
              Not that we mind this division of money, since on balance we regard 
              the undistributed earnings of investees as more valuable to us than 
              the portion paid out. The reason for our thinking is simple: Our 
              investees often have the opportunity to reinvest earnings at high 
              rates of return. So why should we want them paid out? 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To depict something closer to economic 
              reality at Berkshire than reported earnings, though, we employ the 
              concept of "look-through" earnings. As we calculate these, they 
              consist of: (1) the operating earnings reported in the previous 
              section, plus; (2) our share of the retained operating earnings 
              of major investees that, under GAAP accounting, are not reflected 
              in our profits, less; (3) an allowance for the tax that would be 
              paid by Berkshire if these retained earnings of investees had instead 
              been distributed to us. When tabulating "operating earnings" here, 
              we exclude purchase-accounting adjustments as well as capital gains 
              and other major non-recurring items. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following table sets forth our 
              1999 look-through earnings, though I warn you that the figures can 
              be no more than approximate, since they are based on a number of 
              judgment calls. (The dividends paid to us by these investees have 
              been included in the operating earnings itemized on page 13, mostly 
              under "Insurance Group: Net Investment Income.")

            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We made few portfolio changes in 
              1999. As I mentioned earlier, several of the companies in which 
              we have large investments had disappointing business results last 
              year. Nevertheless, we believe these companies have important competitive 
              advantages that will endure over time. This attribute, which makes 
              for good long-term investment results, is one Charlie and I occasionally 
              believe we can identify. More often, however, we can't -- not at 
              least with a high degree of conviction. This explains, by the way, 
              why we don't own stocks of tech companies, even though we share 
              the general view that our society will be transformed by their products 
              and services. Our problem -- which we can't solve by studying up 
              -- is that we have no insights into which participants in the tech 
              field possess a truly <em>durable</em> competitive advantage. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our lack of tech insights, we should 
              add, does not distress us. After all, there are a great many business 
              areas in which Charlie and I have no special capital-allocation 
              expertise. For instance, we bring nothing to the table when it comes 
              to evaluating patents, manufacturing processes or geological prospects. 
              So we simply don't get into judgments in those fields. <br wp="br1">
              <br wp="br2">
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we have a strength, it is in 
              recognizing when we are operating well within our circle of competence 
              and when we are approaching the perimeter. Predicting the long-term 
              economics of companies that operate in fast-changing industries 
              is simply far beyond our perimeter. If others claim predictive skill 
              in those industries -- and seem to have their claims validated by 
              the behavior of the stock market -- we neither envy nor emulate 
              them. Instead, we just stick with what we understand. If we stray, 
              we will have done so inadvertently, not because we got restless 
              and substituted hope for rationality. Fortunately, it's almost certain 
              there will be opportunities from time to time for Berkshire to do 
              well within the circle we've staked out. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now, the prices of the fine 
              businesses we already own are just not that attractive. In other 
              words, we feel much better about the businesses than their stocks. 
              That's why we haven't added to our present holdings. Nevertheless, 
              we haven't yet scaled back our portfolio in a major way: If the 
              choice is between a questionable business at a comfortable price 
              or a comfortable business at a questionable price, we much prefer 
              the latter. What really gets our attention, however, is a comfortable 
              business at a comfortable price. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our reservations about the prices 
              of securities we own apply also to the general level of equity prices. 
              We have never attempted to forecast what the stock market is going 
              to do in the next month or the next year, and we are not trying 
              to do that now. But, as I point out in the enclosed article, equity 
              investors currently seem wildly optimistic in their expectations 
              about future returns. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We see the growth in corporate profits 
              as being largely tied to the business done in the country (GDP), 
              and we see GDP growing at a real rate of about 3%. In addition, 
              we have hypothesized 2% inflation. Charlie and I have no particular 
              conviction about the accuracy of 2%. However, it's the market's 
              view: Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) yield about 
              two percentage points less than the standard treasury bond, and 
              if you believe inflation rates are going to be higher than that, 
              you can profit by simply buying TIPS and shorting Governments. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If profits do indeed grow along 
              with GDP, at about a 5% rate, the valuation placed on American business 
              is unlikely to climb by much more than that. Add in something for 
              dividends, and you emerge with returns from equities that are dramatically 
              less than most investors have either experienced in the past or 
              expect in the future. If investor expectations become more realistic 
              -- and they almost certainly will -- the market adjustment is apt 
              to be severe, particularly in sectors in which speculation has been 
              concentrated. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Berkshire will someday have opportunities 
              to deploy major amounts of cash in equity markets -- we are confident 
              of that. But, as the song goes, "Who knows where or when?" Meanwhile, 
              if anyone starts explaining to you what is going on in the truly-manic 
              portions of this "enchanted" market, you might remember still another 
              line of song: "Fools give you reasons, wise men never try." <br wp="br1">

            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, a number of shareholders 
              have suggested to us that Berkshire repurchase its shares. Usually 
              the requests were rationally based, but a few leaned on spurious 
              logic. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one combination of 
              facts that makes it advisable for a company to repurchase its shares: 
              First, the company has available funds -- cash plus sensible borrowing 
              capacity -- beyond the near-term needs of the business and, second, 
              finds its stock selling in the market below its intrinsic value, 
              conservatively-calculated. To this we add a caveat: Shareholders 
              should have been supplied all the information they need for estimating 
              that value. Otherwise, insiders could take advantage of their uninformed 
              partners and buy out their interests at a fraction of true worth. 
              We have, on rare occasions, seen that happen. Usually, of course, 
              chicanery is employed to drive stock prices up, not down. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The business "needs" that I speak 
              of are of two kinds: First, expenditures that a company must make 
              to maintain its competitive position (e.g., the remodeling of stores 
              at Helzberg's) and, second, optional outlays, aimed at business 
              growth, that management expects will produce more than a dollar 
              of value for each dollar spent (R. C. Willey's expansion into Idaho). 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When available funds exceed needs 
              of those kinds, a company with a growth-oriented shareholder population 
              can buy new businesses or repurchase shares. If a company's stock 
              is selling well below intrinsic value, repurchases usually make 
              the most sense. In the mid-1970s, the wisdom of making these was 
              virtually screaming at managements, but few responded. In most cases, 
              those that did made their owners much wealthier than if alternative 
              courses of action had been pursued. Indeed, during the 1970s (and, spasmodically, for some years 
          thereafter) we searched for companies that were large repurchasers of 
          their shares. This often was a tipoff that the company was both undervalued 
          and run by a shareholder-oriented management. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That day is past. Now, repurchases 
              are all the rage, but are all too often made for an unstated and, 
              in our view, ignoble reason: to pump or support the stock price. 
              The shareholder who chooses to sell today, of course, is benefitted 
              by any buyer, whatever his origin or motives. But the <em>continuing</em> 
              shareholder is penalized by repurchases above intrinsic value. Buying 
              dollar bills for $1.10 is not good business for those who stick 
              around. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie and I admit that we feel 
              confident in estimating intrinsic value for only a portion of traded 
              equities and then only when we employ a range of values, rather 
              than some pseudo-precise figure. Nevertheless, it appears to us 
              that many companies now making repurchases are overpaying departing 
              shareholders at the expense of those who stay. In defense of those 
              companies, I would say that it is natural for CEOs to be optimistic 
              about their own businesses. They also know a whole lot more about 
              them than I do. However, I can't help but feel that too often today's 
              repurchases are dictated by management's desire to "show confidence" 
              or be in fashion rather than by a desire to enhance per-share value. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes, too, companies say they 
              are repurchasing shares to offset the shares issued when stock options 
              granted at much lower prices are exercised. This "buy high, sell 
              low" strategy is one many unfortunate investors have employed -- 
              but never intentionally! Managements, however, seem to follow this 
              perverse activity very cheerfully. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, both option grants and 
              repurchases may make sense -- but if that's the case, it's not because 
              the two activities are logically related. Rationally, a company's 
              decision to repurchase shares or to issue them should stand on its 
              own feet. Just because stock has been issued to satisfy options 
              -- or for any other reason -- does not mean that stock should be 
              repurchased at a price above intrinsic value. Correspondingly, a 
              stock that sells well below intrinsic value should be repurchased 
              whether or not stock has previously been issued (or may be because 
              of outstanding options). 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You should be aware that, at certain 
              times in the past, I have erred in <em>not</em> making repurchases. 
              My appraisal of Berkshire's value was then too conservative or I 
              was too enthused about some alternative use of funds. We have therefore 
              missed some opportunities -- though Berkshire's trading volume at 
              these points was too light for us to have done much buying, which 
              means that the gain in our per-share value would have been minimal. 
              (A repurchase of, say, 2% of a company's shares at a 25% discount 
              from per-share intrinsic value produces only a % gain in that value 
              at most -- and even less if the funds could alternatively have been 
              deployed in value-building moves.) 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the letters we've received 
              clearly imply that the writer is unconcerned about intrinsic value 
              considerations but instead wants us to trumpet an intention to repurchase 
              so that the stock will rise (or quit going down). If the writer 
              wants to sell tomorrow, his thinking makes sense -- for him! -- 
              but if he intends to hold, he should instead hope the stock falls 
              and trades in enough volume for us to buy a lot of it. That's the 
              only way a repurchase program can have any real benefit for a continuing 
              shareholder. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will not repurchase shares unless 
              we believe Berkshire stock is selling well below intrinsic value, 
              conservatively calculated. Nor will we attempt to talk the stock 
              up or down. (Neither publicly or privately have I ever told anyone 
              to buy or sell Berkshire shares.) Instead we will give all shareholders 
              -- and potential shareholders -- the same valuation-related information 
              we would wish to have if our positions were reversed. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, when the A shares fell 
              below $45,000, we considered making repurchases. We decided, however, 
              to delay buying, if indeed we elect to do <em>any</em>, until shareholders 
              have had the chance to review this report. If we do find that repurchases 
              make sense, we will only rarely place bids on the New York Stock 
              Exchange ("NYSE"). Instead, we will respond to offers made directly 
              to us at or below the NYSE bid. If you wish to offer stock, have 
              your broker call Mark Millard at 402-346-1400. When a trade occurs, 
              the broker can either record it in the "third market" or on the 
              NYSE. We will favor purchase of the B shares if they are selling 
              at more than a 2% discount to the A. We will not engage in transactions 
              involving fewer than 10 shares of A or 50 shares of B. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please be clear about one point: 
              We will <em>never</em> make purchases with the intention of stemming 
              a decline in Berkshire's price. Rather we will make them if and 
              when we believe that they represent an attractive use of the Company's 
              money. At best, repurchases are likely to have only a very minor 
              effect on the future rate of gain in our stock's intrinsic value. 
            <p><strong>Shareholder-Designated Contributions</strong> 
        <p> 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About 97.3% of all eligible shares 
              participated in Berkshire's 1999 shareholder-designated contributions 
              program, with contributions totaling $17.2 million. A full description 
              of the program appears on pages 70 - 71. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cumulatively, over the 19 years 
              of the program, Berkshire has made contributions of $147 million 
              pursuant to the instructions of our shareholders. The rest of Berkshire's 
              giving is done by our subsidiaries, which stick to the philanthropic 
              patterns that prevailed before they were acquired (except that their 
              former owners themselves take on the responsibility for their personal 
              charities). In aggregate, our subsidiaries made contributions of 
              $13.8 million in 1999, including in-kind donations of $2.5 million. 
            <p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To participate in future programs, 
              you must own Class A shares that are registered in the name of the 
              actual owner, not the nominee name of a broker, bank or depository. 
              Shares not so registered on August 31, 2000, will be ineligible 
              for the 2000 program. When you get the contributions form from us, 
              return it promptly so that it does not get put aside or forgotten. 
              Designations received after the due date will not be honored.</em>

            <p><strong>The Annual Meeting</strong> <br wp="br1">
          <br wp="br2">
            <p><strong> </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year's Woodstock 
              Weekend for Capitalists will follow a format slightly different 
              from that of recent years. We need to make a change because the 
              Aksarben Coliseum, which served us well the past three years, is 
              gradually being closed down. Therefore, we are relocating to the 
              Civic Auditorium (which is on Capitol Avenue between 18<sup>th</sup> 
              and 19<sup>th</sup>, behind the Doubletree Hotel), the only other 
              facility in Omaha offering the space we require. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Civic, however, is located in 
              downtown Omaha, and we would create a parking and traffic nightmare 
              if we were to meet there on a weekday. We will, therefore, convene 
              on Saturday, April 29, with the doors opening at 7 a.m., the movie 
              beginning at 8:30 and the meeting itself commencing at 9:30. As 
              in the past, we will run until 3:30 with a short break at noon for 
              food, which will be available at the Civic's concession stands. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An attachment to the proxy material 
              that is enclosed with this report explains how you can obtain the 
              credential you will need for admission to the meeting and other 
              events. As for plane, hotel and car reservations, we have again 
              signed up American Express (800-799-6634) to give you special help. 
              In our normal fashion, we will run buses from the larger hotels 
              to the meeting. After the meeting, the buses will make trips back 
              to the hotels and to Nebraska Furniture Mart, Borsheim's and the 
              airport. Even so, you are likely to find a car useful. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have scheduled the meeting in 
              2002 and 2003 on the customary first Saturday in May. In 2001, however, 
              the Civic is already booked on that Saturday, so we will meet on 
              April 28. The Civic should fit our needs well on any weekend, since 
              there will then be more than ample parking in nearby lots and garages 
              as well as on streets. We will also be able to greatly enlarge the 
              space we give exhibitors. So, overcoming my normal commercial reticence, 
              I will see that you have a wide display of Berkshire products at 
              the Civic that you can <em>purchase</em>. As a benchmark, in 1999 
              shareholders bought 3,059 pounds of See's candy, $16,155 of World 
              Book Products, 1,928 pairs of Dexter shoes, 895 sets of Quikut knives, 
              1,752 golf balls with the Berkshire Hathaway logo and 3,446 items 
              of Berkshire apparel. I know you can do better. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, we also initiated the 
              sale of at least eight fractions of Executive Jet aircraft. We will 
              again have an array of models at the Omaha airport for your inspection 
              on Saturday and Sunday. Ask an EJA representative at the Civic about 
              viewing any of these planes. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dairy Queen will also be on hand 
              at the Civic and again will donate all proceeds to the Children's 
              Miracle Network. Last year we sold 4,586 Dilly&reg; bars, fudge 
              bars and vanilla/orange bars. Additionally, GEICO will have a booth 
              that will be staffed by a number of our top counselors from around 
              the country, all of them ready to supply you with auto insurance 
              quotes. In most cases, GEICO will be able to offer you a special 
              shareholder's discount. Bring the details of your existing insurance, 
              and check out whether we can save you some money. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Ajit Jain and his associates 
              will be on hand to offer both no-commission annuities and a liability 
              policy with jumbo limits of a size rarely available elsewhere. Talk 
              to Ajit and learn how to protect yourself and your family against 
              a $10 million judgment. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NFM's newly remodeled complex, located 
              on a 75-acre site on 72<sup>nd</sup> Street between Dodge and Pacific, 
              is open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. on weekdays and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. 
              on Saturdays and Sundays. This operation offers an unrivaled breadth 
              of merchandise -- furniture, electronics, appliances, carpets and 
              computers -- all at can't-be-beat prices. In 1999 NFM did more than 
              $300 million of business at its 72<sup>nd</sup> Street location, 
              which in a metropolitan area of 675,000 is an absolute miracle. 
              During the Thursday, April 27 to Monday, May 1 period, any shareholder 
              presenting his or her meeting credential will receive a discount 
              that is customarily given only to employees. We have offered this 
              break to shareholders the last couple of years, and sales have been 
              amazing. In last year's five-day "Berkshire Weekend," NFM's volume 
              was $7.98 million, an increase of 26% from 1998 and 51% from 1997. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Borsheim's -- the largest jewelry 
              store in the country except for Tiffany's Manhattan store -- will 
              have two shareholder-only events. The first will be a champagne 
              and dessert party from 6 p.m.-10 p.m. on Friday, April 28. The second, 
              the main gala, will be from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Sunday, April 30. 
              On that day, Charlie and I will be on hand to sign <em>sales tickets</em>. 
              Shareholder prices will be available Thursday through Monday, so 
              if you wish to avoid the largest crowds, which will form on Friday 
              evening and Sunday, come at other times and identify yourself as 
              a shareholder. On Saturday, we will be open until 7 p.m. Borsheim's 
              operates on a gross margin that is fully twenty percentage points 
              below that of its major rivals, so be prepared to be blown away 
              by both our prices and selection. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the mall outside of Borsheim's, 
              we will again have Bob Hamman -- the best bridge player the game 
              has ever seen -- available to play with our shareholders on Sunday. 
              We will also have a few other experts playing at additional tables. 
              In 1999, we had more demand than tables, but we will cure that problem 
              this year. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patrick Wolff, twice US chess champion, 
              will again be in the mall playing blindfolded against all comers. 
              He tells me that he has never tried to play more than four games 
              simultaneously while handicapped this way but might try to bump 
              that limit to five or six this year. If you're a chess fan, take 
              Patrick on -- but be sure to check his blindfold before your first 
              move. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gorat's -- my favorite steakhouse 
              -- will again be open exclusively for Berkshire shareholders on 
              Sunday, April 30, and will be serving from 4 p.m. until about midnight. 
              Please remember that you can't come to Gorat's on Sunday without 
              a reservation. To make one, call 402-551-3733 on April 3 (<em>but 
              not before</em>). If Sunday is sold out, try Gorat's on one of the 
              other evenings you will be in town. I make a "quality check" of 
              Gorat's about once a week and can report that their rare T-bone 
              (with a double order of hash browns) is still unequaled throughout 
              the country. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The usual baseball game will be 
              held at Rosenblatt Stadium at 7 p.m. on Saturday night. This year 
              the Omaha Golden Spikes will play the Iowa Cubs. Come early, because 
              that's when the real action takes place. Those who attended last 
              year saw your Chairman pitch to Ernie Banks. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This encounter proved to be the 
              titanic duel that the sports world had long awaited. After the first 
              few pitches -- which were not my best, but when have I ever thrown 
              my best? -- I fired a brushback at Ernie just to let him know who 
              was in command. Ernie charged the mound, and I charged the plate. 
              But a clash was avoided because we became exhausted before reaching 
              each other. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ernie was dissatisfied with his 
              performance last year and has been studying the game films all winter. 
              As you may know, Ernie had 512 home runs in his career as a Cub. 
              Now that he has spotted telltale weaknesses in my delivery, he expects 
              to get #513 on April 29. I, however, have learned new ways to disguise 
              my "flutterball." Come and watch this matchup. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should add that I have extracted 
              a promise from Ernie that he will not hit a "come-backer" at me 
              since I would never be able to duck in time to avoid it. My reflexes 
              are like Woody Allen's, who said his were so slow that he was once 
              hit by a car being pushed by two guys. 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our proxy statement contains instructions 
              about obtaining tickets to the game and also a large quantity of 
              other information that should help you enjoy your visit in Omaha.
